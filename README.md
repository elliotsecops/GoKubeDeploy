# GoKubeDeploy
GoKubeDeploy is a minimalist project that demonstrates how to deploy a simple Go application on Kubernetes. It focuses on creating a health checker (/healthz) that returns a JSON indicating the status of the application. The project consists of a single Go file (healthcheck.go) that implements the web server and the health endpoint, a Dockerfile to build the container image and a Kubernetes deployment file (deployment.yaml). The latter configures the application deployment, including replicas, resource limits and liveness and readiness probes to ensure high availability and proper lifecycle management. GoKubeDeploy, while simple in design, illustrates best practices for deploying Go applications on Kubernetes and serves as a solid foundation for more complex projects.
